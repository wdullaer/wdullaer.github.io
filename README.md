# Wdullaer.com blog

This is the repository that is powering my personal scratchpad / blog.
The theme is based on [Thinny](http://github.com/camporez/Thinny.git)
I might switch to [Mediator](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator) in the future

If you want to run the blog locally (because it is that awesome), you can run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
More interesting information on how to use Jekyll with github pages can be found on this [github help page](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/)
