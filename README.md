# Wdullaer.com blog

This is the repository that is powering my personal scratchpad / blog.

The theme is based on [Thinny](http://github.com/camporez/Thinny.git), but I might switch to [Mediator](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator) in the future.

If you want to run the blog locally (because it is that awesome), you can run any of the following:

1. Using `ruby` and `bundler`

  ```bash
  bundle exec jekyll serve
  ```
2. Using [docker](https://docker.com) and [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose)

  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

More information on how to use Jekyll with github pages can be found on this [github help page](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/)
