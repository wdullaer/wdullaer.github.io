excerpt: "It's always a dilemma: latex is great for formulas but well, not so much at making slideshows or posters. Powerpoint on the other hand is great at the latter, but sucks balls at the first. No matter which tool you use to create your powerpoint, a lot of frustration, broken coffee mugs and hairloss ensues. Wouldn't it be great if you could just typeset formulas in powerpoint using latex?"

It's always a dilemma: latex is great for formulas but well, not so much at making slideshows or posters. Powerpoint on the other hand is great at the latter, but sucks balls at the first. No matter which tool you use to create your powerpoint, a lot of frustration, broken coffee mugs and hairloss ensues. Wouldn't it be great if you could just typeset formulas in powerpoint using latex?

Enter: [Tex 4 PPT](http://sites.google.com/site/tex4ppt/)
It renders your latex formula in the native ppt vector format. This means that it'll look good at any resolution.

It requires a working Miktex install and microsoft's .net framework.
