I'm Wouter Dullaert.

I'm an IT architect at Toyota Motor Europe, which means I spend a lot of time experimenting with new tech to ensure we use the right tools for the job.

In my spare time I enjoy tinkering with web technology, [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wdullaer.mnemonic), music production, playing jazz and running.

Whenever possible, I spend time away from home with my partner to see as much of the world as we can.

This blog serves as a notebook for some of the techie problems I've solved over the years. I have added the content I've created on <http://soundhacker.be> and <http://olezfdtd.wordpress.com> to this blog and I intend to cover more subjects in the future.
