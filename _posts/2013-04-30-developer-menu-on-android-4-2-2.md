**If you recently bought a Nexus 4 or upgraded your phone to Android 4.2 you'll probably be missing the "Developer options" in your settings menu. **






Fortunately, Google didn't remove the developer options from their new version of Android, they just hid it from prying eyes.
If you _press 5 times on the "Build-number"_ in the "About phone" menu, your phone will recognise you as a developer and the Developer options menu will magically reappear.
